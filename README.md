Q42.HueApi
=========

Open source library for communication with the Philips Hue bridge.

Download directly from NuGet [Q42.HueApi on NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/Q42.HueApi).

## How to use?
Some basic usage examples

### Bridge
Before you can communicate with the Philips Hue Bridge, you need to register your application:
	
	HueClient client = new HueClient("ip");
	client.RegisterAsync("mypersonalappname", "mypersonalappkey");
	
If you already registered an appname, you can initialize the HueClient with the app's key:	

	client.Initialize("mypersonalappkey");

### Control the lamps
Main usage of this library is to be able to control your lamps. We use a LampCommand for that. A LampCommand can be send to one or more / multiple lamps. A LampCommand can hold a color, effect, on/off etc.

	var command = new LampCommand();
	command.On = true;
	
There are some helpers to set a color on a command:
	
	//Turn the lamp on and set a Hex color for the command
	command.TurnOn().SetColor("FF00AA")
	
LampCommands also support Effects and Alerts

	//Blink once
	command.Alert = Alerts.Once;
	
	//Or start a colorloop
	command.Effect = Effects.ColorLoop;
	
Once you have composed your command, send it to one or more lamps

	client.SendCommandAsync(command, new List<string> { "1" });
	
Or send it to all lamps

	client.SendCommandAsync(command);
